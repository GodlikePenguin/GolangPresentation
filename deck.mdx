---
## Background
- Go was developed at Google in 2007 and v1.0 was publicly released in 2012
- It was intended to couple the benefits of safety and speed from strictly typed languages with the readability and usability from dynamically typed languages
- Looks "C like" but with lots of the syntactic sugar of more modern languages
- Multi paradigm, but mainly used for networking and systems applications

```notes
Here safety refers to both type and memory safety

Runtime and compilation speed
```
---
## Goals in depth
- Easy to learn and write
- Type safety and memory safety
- Easy concurrency
- Low latency garbage collection
- Fast compilation and execution
---
## Hello World
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var message string
  message = "Hello world"
  fmt.Println(message)
}
```
- Go explicitly uses a keyword (`func`, `var`) as well as the type

<em>except when using...</em>

---

## Type Inference

```go
var message string
message = "Hello world"
// is the same as
var message = "Hello world"
// is the same as
message := "Hello world"
```
- The type, and even the var keyword in variable declarations are optional

---
## Type system
- Strongly typed (No implicit conversions)
- Statically typed (Although more freedom than C)
- Pseudo Object Oriented

❌          | ✅
------------|-------------
Classes     | Structs
Inheritence | Interfaces
Generics    | People who pretend they don't need generics

---
## Structs

```go
type Person struct {
  FirstName string
  LastName string
}

p := Person{FirstName: "John"}
fmt.Println(p.FirstName) // prints 'John'
```

- A Struct is a typed collection of fields, each of which can be accessed by dot notation
- Dot notation for both pointer and non pointer types (I am looking at you C++)

---
## Struct methods
```go
func (p Person) String() string {
  return p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName
}

p := Person{FirstName: "John", "Smith"}
fmt.Println(p.String()) // prints 'John Smith'
```

- You can also add methods to structs, by specifing the struct type as part of the method signature
- These are also accessed by dot notation

---
## Interfaces

```go
type Stringer interface {
  String() string
}  
```
- We use interfaces to specify a 'type' which implements one or more methods
- We don't care about the implementation of those methods, but the argument and return type must match
- A struct implicitly implements an interface without the need for a decorator (e.g. `class Foo implements Bah` in Java)

---
## Embedded types: Pseudo Inheritence
```go
type Employee struct {
  Person
  Job string
}
```
- If a field in a struct is not named, all it's attributes and methods are applied directly to the outer struct
- This **DOES NOT** mean we can use an `Employee` as a `Person`, they are still separate types
- Similar to private inheritence from C++

---
## What are we missing


<div style={{fontSize: '1.5em', textAlign: 'left', marginTop: '50px'}}>Mentioned before:</div>

- Inheritence
- Generics

<div style={{fontSize: '1.5em', textAlign: 'left',}}>Not mentioned:</div>

- Operator or Function overloading

---
## Concurrency

```
Threading sucks
Roses are red
Violets are blue
So do you
```

Go keeps concurrency simple
---
## Goroutines
- A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.
- Allows you to run a function in another thread
- Goroutines run in the same address space so access to shared memory can cause race conditions
- Channels (message passing) are a thread safe way for goroutines to communicate 
---
## Starting a new goroutine
```go
func reallyUsefulMethod(message string) {
  fmt.Println(message)
}

go reallyUsefulMethod("Hello from another goroutine")
```
- As simple as just placing the `go` keyword before a function call
---
## Channels
```go
messages := make(chan string)
messages <- "ping"
response := <- messages
```
- Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values
- Can be simplex or duplex
- Have to be created using the `make` keyword
- Uses the `<-` operator to send/receive data

---
Enough boring talk, lets see concurrency in action

func main() {
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	in := make(chan float64, 10)
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	out := make(chan float64, 10)
	//The numbers to find the square roots of

# "That was terrible, you could have done it in one thread!"

---
## Better synchronization
- Whilst we can just use channels to synchronize our code, there are better options

### The `sync` package
- Go has a number of built in methods and structs to help you code concurrently, two examples: **WaitGroup**, **Mutex**
---
## WaitGroup
- A WaitGroup is a threadsafe struct that keeps track of a counter and can block a thread until the counter reaches 0
- Increment the WaitGroup for each goroutine started
- When a goroutine finishes, it decrements the counter again

---
Let's look at WaitGroups in action
<small><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/mKwVj6uDkKc">https://play.golang.org/p/mKwVj6uDkKc</a></small>
<RunnableBlock
  value={`package main
+S
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sync"
)

type answer struct {
	answer float64

func main() {
	//Create a channel of input numbers

  // channel is closed

		out <- answer{answer: math.Sqrt(num), id: id}
	}
	//Let the WaitGroup know we're done
	wg.Done()

## How about Mutex

- Same `lock` and `unlock` idea as seen in many places
- However with struct embedding, we can add a Mutex to any existing struct:
```go
type Box struct {
  Value int
  sync.Mutex
}
```
- Can now call `.Lock()` and `.Unlock()` on the Box - very easy to create thread safe structs

---
## Select
- Similar to a `switch` statement, but switches on channels rather than a variable
- Can either try to read from, or write to a channel on each branch
- If no option is possible then block until one is
- Can set a default option so there is no blocking

---
Select statement in action

<RunnableBlock value={`package main

func main() {
  //Make two channels
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)
  //Send to channel 1 after 1 second
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "one"
	}()
  //Send to channel 2 after 2 seconds
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "two"
	}()
  //Run the select statement twice
	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-c1: //If we can read from c1, run this statement
			fmt.Println("received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-c2: //If we can read from c2, run this statement
			fmt.Println("received", msg2)
		}
	}
}`}

## Summary
- Simple concurrency with mechanisms to help write efficient thread safe code
- Goroutines are lightweight, so we can run hundreds of thousands of them
