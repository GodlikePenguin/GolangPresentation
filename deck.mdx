## Background
- Go was developed at Google in 2007 and publically released in 2012
- It was intended to couple the benefits of safety and speed from strictly typed languages with the readability and usability from dynamically typed languages
- Looks "C like" but with lots of the syntactic sugar of modern languages
---
## Primative types
```go
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```
---
## Variables
```go
var i int
var i int = 0
var i = 0 //infers that i is an int
i := 0 //infers that i is an int
```
---
## Basic hello world program
```go
import "fmt"
func foo() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```
---
## Test
import Test from 'components/Test'

<Test value={`package main
func main() {
  println("hello wld")
}`}
  initialOutput={'hello wld'} />

---
The end
