---
## Background
- Go was developed at Google in 2007 and v1.0 was publicly released in 2012
- It was intended to couple the benefits of safety and speed from strictly typed languages with the readability and usability from dynamically typed languages
- Looks "C like" but with lots of the syntactic sugar of more modern languages
- Multi paradigm, but mainly used for networking and systems applications

```notes
Here safety refers to both type and memory safety

Runtime and compilation speed
```
---
## Goals in depth
- Easy to learn and write
- Type safety and memory safety
- Easy concurrency
- Low latency garbage collection
- Fast compilation and execution
---
## Hello World
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var message string
  message = "Hello world"
  fmt.Println(message)
}
```
- Go explicitly uses a keyword (`func`, `var`) as well as the type

<em>except when using...</em>

---

## Type Inference

```go
var message string
message = "Hello world"
// is the same as
var message = "Hello world"
// is the same as
message := "Hello world"
```
- The type, and even the var keyword in variable declarations are optional

---
## Type system
- Strongly typed (No implicit conversions)
- Statically typed (Although more freedom than C)
- Pseudo Object Oriented

<table style={{textAlign: 'left', width: '100%', borderCollapse: 'collapse', fontSize: '32px', td: {padding: '5px'}}}>
  <thead style={{borderBottom: 'solid 1px #FFF'}}>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="public/img/cross.png" style={{height: "25px", width: "25px"}} /></th>
      <th><img src="public/img/tick.png" style={{height: "25px", width: "25px"}} /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr style={{borderBottom: 'solid 1px #FFF'}}>
      <td style={{paddingRight: '10px', paddingTop: '5px', paddingBottom: '5px'}}>Classes</td>
      <td>Structs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{borderBottom: 'solid 1px #FFF'}}>
      <td style={{paddingRight: '10px', paddingTop: '5px', paddingBottom: '5px'}}>Inheritence</td>
      <td>Interfaces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{borderBottom: 'solid 1px #FFF'}}>
      <td style={{paddingRight: '10px', paddingTop: '5px', paddingBottom: '5px'}}>Generics</td>
      <td>People who pretend they don't need generics</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

---
## Structs

```go
type Person struct {
  FirstName string
  LastName string
}

p := Person{FirstName: "John"}
fmt.Println(p.FirstName) // prints 'John'
```

- A Struct is a typed collection of fields, each of which can be accessed by dot notation
- Dot notation for both pointer and non pointer types (I am looking at you C++)

---
## Struct methods
```go
func (p Person) String() string {
  return p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName
}

p := Person{FirstName: "John", "Smith"}
fmt.Println(p.String()) // prints 'John Smith'
```

- You can also add methods to structs, by specifing the struct type as part of the method signature
- These are also accessed by dot notation

---
## Interfaces

```go
type Stringer interface {
  String() string
}  
```
- We use interfaces to specify a 'type' which implements one or more methods
- We don't care about the implementation of those methods, but the argument and return type must match
- A struct implicitly implements an interface without the need for a decorator (e.g. `class Foo implements Bah` in Java)

---
## Embedded types: Pseudo Inheritence
```go
type Employee struct {
  Person
  Job string
}
```
- If a field in a struct is not named, all it's attributes and methods are applied directly to the outer struct
- This **DOES NOT** mean we can use an `Employee` as a `Person`, they are still separate types
- Similar to private inheritence from C++

---
## What are we missing


<div style={{fontSize: '1.5em', textAlign: 'left', marginTop: '50px'}}>Mentioned before:</div>

- Inheritence
- Generics

<div style={{fontSize: '1.5em', textAlign: 'left',}}>Not mentioned:</div>

- Operator or Function overloading

---
## Concurrency

```
Threading sucks
Roses are red
Violets are blue
So do you
```

Go keeps concurrency simple
---
## Goroutines
- A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.
- Allows you to run a function in another thread
- Goroutines run in the same address space so access to shared memory can cause race conditions
- Channels (message passing) are a thread safe way for goroutines to communicate 
---
## Starting a new goroutine
```go
func reallyUsefulMethod(message string) {
  fmt.Println(message)
}

go reallyUsefulMethod("Hello from another goroutine")
```
- As simple as just placing the `go` keyword before a function call
---
## Channels
```go
messages := make(chan string)
messages <- "ping"
response := <- messages
```
- Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values
- Can be simplex or duplex
- Have to be created using the `make` keyword
- Uses the `<-` operator to send/receive data

---
Enough boring talk, lets see concurrency in action [(External)](https://play.golang.org/p/GVTko-E7UiZ)
<RunnableBlock value={`package main
+S
import "math"
+S
func main() {
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	in := make(chan float64, 10)
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	out := make(chan float64, 10)
	//The numbers to find the square roots of
	inNums := []float64{36.0, 49.0, 64.0}
	//Put the numbers in the in channel
	for _, num := range inNums {
		in <- num
	}
	//Closing a channel means we're not going to send
  // anything else on it
	close(in)
	//Start a goroutine
	go sqrt(in, out)
	//Iterate through the responses and print them
	for num := range out {
		println(num)
	}
}
+S
func sqrt(in <-chan float64, out chan<- float64) {
	//loop through the input numbers and place the 
  // resulting square root in the output channel
	//This loop will keep running until the 'in'
  // channel is closed
	for num := range in {
		out <- math.Sqrt(num)
	}
	//Close the out channel so the main thread knows
  // we're done
	close(out)
}`}
  height="600px" />
---
# "That was terrible, you could have done it in one thread!"

---
## Better synchronization
- Whilst we can just use channels to synchronize our code, there are better options

### The `sync` package
- Go has a number of built in methods and structs to help you code concurrently, two examples: **WaitGroup**, **Mutex**
---
## WaitGroup
- A WaitGroup is a threadsafe struct that keeps track of a counter and can block a thread until the counter reaches 0
- Increment the WaitGroup for each goroutine started
- When a goroutine finishes, it decrements the counter again

---
Let's look at WaitGroups in action [(External)](https://play.golang.org/p/mKwVj6uDkKc)
<RunnableBlock
  value={`package main
+S
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sync"
)
+S
type answer struct {
	answer float64
	id int
}
+S
func main() {
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	in := make(chan float64, 10)
	//Create a channel of input numbers
	out := make(chan answer, 10)
	//The numbers to find the square roots of
	inNums := []float64{36.0, 49.0, 64.0}
	//Put the numbers in the in channel
	for _, num := range inNums {
		in <- num
	}
	//Closing a channel means we're not going to send anything else on it
	close(in)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	//Start many goroutines
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go sqrt(in, out, &wg, i)
	}
	//Wait for all the goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()
  +S
	close(out)
	//Iterate through the responses and print them
	for num := range out {
		fmt.Println("answer", num.answer, "calculated by routine", num.id, ",")
	}
}
+S
func sqrt(in <-chan float64, out chan<- answer, wg *sync.WaitGroup, id int) {
	//loop through the input numbers and place the 
  // resulting square root in the output channel
	//This loop will keep running until the 'in' 
  // channel is closed
	for num := range in {
		out <- answer{answer: math.Sqrt(num), id: id}
	}
	//Let the WaitGroup know we're done
	wg.Done()
}`}

## How about Mutex

- Same `lock` and `unlock` idea as seen in many places
- However with struct embedding, we can add a Mutex to any existing struct:
```go
type Box struct {
  Value int
  sync.Mutex
}
```
- Can now call `.Lock()` and `.Unlock()` on the Box - very easy to create thread safe structs

---
## Select
- Similar to a `switch` statement, but switches on channels rather than a variable
- Can either try to read from, or write to a channel on each branch
- If no option is possible then block until one is
- Can set a default option so there is no blocking

---
Select statement in action [(External)](https://play.golang.org/p/A_jGir7z276)
<RunnableBlock value={`package main
+S
import "time"
import "fmt"
+S
func main() {
  //Make two channels
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)
  //Send to channel 1 after 1 second
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "one"
	}()
  //Send to channel 2 after 2 seconds
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "two"
	}()
  //Run the select statement twice
	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-c1: //If we can read from c1, run this statement
			fmt.Println("received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-c2: //If we can read from c2, run this statement
			fmt.Println("received", msg2)
		}
	}
}`}

## Summary
- Simple concurrency with mechanisms to help write efficient thread safe code
- Goroutines are lightweight, so we can run hundreds of thousands of them
