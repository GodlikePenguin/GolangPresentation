## Background
- Go was developed at Google in 2007 and publically released in 2012
- It was intended to couple the benefits of safety and speed from strictly typed languages with the readability and usability from dynamically typed languages
- Looks "C like" but with lots of the syntactic sugar of more modern languages
---
## Goals in depth
- Easy to learn
- Type safety and memory safety
- Easy concurrency
- Low latency garbage collection
- Fast compilation
---
## Basic hello world
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```
There are three main parts of a Go file...
---
## Package declaration
<div id='hilight1'></div>

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```
- Each file must belong to a package
- Variables and functions accessed via their package names 

<HiLight id='hilight1' start='package' end='main' />
---
## Imports
<div id='hilight2'></div>

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```
- The set of packages required for this file
- If a package is imported it must be used*

<HiLight id='hilight2' start='import' end='"fmt"' />
---
## ...and the rest
<div id='hilight3'></div>

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```
- The variables and functions declared in this file

<HiLight id='hilight3' start='func' end='}' />
---
## Type inference
```go
var foo int
foo = 10
//is the same as
var foo = 10
//is the same as
foo := 10
```
Declarations
---
## Interactive Hello world
import RunnableBlock from 'components/RunnableBlock'

<RunnableBlock value={`package main
func main() {
  println("hello wld")
}`}
  initialOutput={'hello wld'} />

---
The end
