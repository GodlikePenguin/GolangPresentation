# Golang Presentation
Adventure into using `mdx-deck` to produce a presentation about Golang, specifically the basics of the language and a deeper look at concurrency

You can either run an interactive version of the presentation (including Runnable code blocks!) by using the script `./startpresentation.sh`. This requires Docker, and uses [GoExec](https://github.com/GodlikePenguin/GoExec) to remotely execute Go code.

PDF versions of the presentation are available from the Releases tab.
